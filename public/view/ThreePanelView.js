                  How this program work ?
                  There are 3 panels: left, right and result.
                  These 3 panels are children of the parent component ThreeViewPanel.
                  LeftPanel has an input field.
                  RightPanel has an input field.
                  When these input fields are changed, the change is going to be communicated to ThreeViewPanel (the parent).
                  ThreeViewPanel is going to change its STATE accordingly.
                  ThreeViewPanel then pass variables in its STATE to ResultPanel to calculate the result.

                  When you attempt this example, please try to see the difference between State and Props
                  > variables in state can be changed with setState.
                  > variables in props (passed down from parent component) cannot be changed. READONLY
